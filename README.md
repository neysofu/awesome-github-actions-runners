# Awesome GitHub Actions runners 🏃🏾‍♀️🤖

![Awesome badge](assets/awesome.png) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made_with-Markdown-purple) ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/neysofu/awesome-github-actions-runners) [![X (formerly Twitter) Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/neysofu)](https://twitter.com/neysofu)

GitHub Actions are pretty damn cool, but lord knows the official runners are slow, unreliable, and [expensive](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions#about-billing-for-github-actions). Self-hosted runners are typically championed as the better alternative, but they're also a pain to set up and maintain and they come with important security [concerns](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#self-hosted-runner-security).

**It doesn't have to be one or the other. Most people don't know this, but there's quite a few third-party GH Actions runner services out there, most of which require no changes at all to your CI workflows.** These are easy to migrate to, much cheaper than official runners, and often faster.

## List of providers

### BuildJet ⭐

[BuildJet](https://buildjet.com/for-github-actions/docs) offers managed performance runners for GitHub Actions.

Pricing [here](https://buildjet.com/for-github-actions/docs/about/pricing).

Notable features:
- **1-line change to get faster and cheaper builds in most projects.**
- 64GiB disk storage[^1a] and 20GiB free cache per repository[^1b] via [`buildjet/cache`](https://github.com/BuildJet/cache) (as opposed to 16GiB disk storage and 10GiB free cache per repository in GitHub official runners).
- ARM support.[^1c] 
- Built-in support for [`Swatinem/rust-cache`](https://github.com/Swatinem/rust-cache) via `backend: buildjet`.
- **(Coming soon)** SOC2 compliance.[^1d] 🚧

### Namespace ⭐

[Namespace](https://cloud.namespace.so/docs/features/faster-github-actions) provides development environments, remote builders, ephemeral environments, managed CI runners, and more.

Pricing [here](https://cloud.namespace.so/pricing).

Notable features:
- **1-line change to get faster and cheaper builds in most projects.**
- Up to 250GiB disk storage and 100GiB cache, considerably more than both BuildJet and GitHub official runners.
- Caching is done via mounted volumes, which is API-incompatible with [`actions/cache`](https://github.com/actions/cache) but much faster and more reliable. A compatibility layer is [available](https://cloud.namespace.so/docs/actions/nscloud-cache-action#github-cache-action-compatibility-mode) but marked as deprecated.[^2a]
- Dedicated remote Docker builders with large capacity, zero-configuration incremental caching, ARM support, and more.[^2b]
- Many, many more CI solutions other than GitHub Actions runners. Check out their website for more information.

### Actuated ⭐

[Actuated](https://actuated.dev/) brings fast and secure GitHub Actions to your own infrastructure. It's a more ops-heavy solution compared to fully managed runners, but this comes with significant benefits and attractive pricing.

Pricing [here](https://actuated.dev/pricing).

Notable features:
- Native ARM support.[^3a]
- Runs directly within your own datacenter, which is useful if you work with large container images or datasets.
- Live debug stuck jobs over SSH.[^3b]
- Flat-rate billing based on the maximum allowed number of concurrent jobs, so the cost stays the same no matter how many minutes you use.
- Cool development blog showcasing many kinds of demoes, examples, and guides.[^3c]

### Cirun

[Cirun](https://cirun.io/) is a tool which lets you **create on-demand self-hosted GitHub Actions runners on your cloud**. After connecting your cloud provider of choice, it's simple to set up and cheap to run.

Pricing [here](https://cirun.io/#pricing).

Notable features:
- **1-line change to get faster and cheaper builds in most projects.**[^4a]
- **Free for public repositories!**
- Cheap, flat-rate pricing based on the number of private repositories you run Cirun on.
- Native ARM support.
- GPU support.[^4b]
- Support for all major cloud providers.[^4c]
- Built by just one developer ([Amit Kumar](https://github.com/aktech)) in their spare time, so long-term maintenance is a concern.

### WarpBuild

[WarpBuild](https://www.warpbuild.com/) offers high performance runners for GitHub Actions. It's a very new product made by the creators of [Argonaut](https://www.argonaut.dev/) and it has few features compared to other providers, but it's still worth keeping an eye on as it's likely to improve over time.

Pricing [here](https://www.warpbuild.com/pricing).

Notable features:
- 1-line change to get faster and cheaper builds in most projects.[^warp-1click]
- Support for x86-64 and ARM runners with unlimited concurrency.
- **Live debug failed jobs over SSH.**[^warp-debug]
- Discounts for open-source projects and young startups, and referral programs to get extra minutes.[^warp-pricing]
- Minimal documentation and unclear hardware specs. ⚠️
- **(Coming soon)** Windows, macOS, and custom runner images support (~Jan 2024). 🚧

### Ubicloud

[Ubicloud](https://www.ubicloud.com/docs/github-actions-integration/quickstart) brings IaaS solutions to bare metal servers, but it also offers a managed platform. GitHub Actions runners are part of this offering. It doesn't seem to have any feature that other providers lack, but it has one of the most attractive pricing plans in the market.

Notable features:
- **1-line change to get faster and cheaper builds in most projects.**[^ubicloud-cheap]

### GitRunners

[GitRunners](https://gitrunners.com/) speeds up GitHub actions with cost-effective performance runners. It's cheaper than GitHub official runners, but doesn't hold up as well against other third-party runners.

Pricing [here](https://gitrunners.com/#pricing).

Notable features:
- 1-line change to get faster and cheaper builds in most projects.
- **(Coming soon)** Persistent storage and mounted volumes. 🚧
