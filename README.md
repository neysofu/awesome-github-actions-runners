# Awesome GitHub Actions runners ‚ö°ü§ñ

![Awesome badge](assets/awesome.png) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made_with-Markdown-purple) ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/neysofu/awesome-github-actions-runners) [![X (formerly Twitter) Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/neysofu)](https://twitter.com/neysofu)

GitHub Actions are pretty damn cool, but lord knows the official runners are slow, unreliable, and [expensive](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions#about-billing-for-github-actions). Self-hosted runners are typically championed as the better alternative, but they're also a pain to set up and maintain and they come with important security [concerns](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#self-hosted-runner-security).

**It doesn't have to be one or the other. Most people don't know this, but there's quite a few third-party GH Actions runner services out there, most of which require no changes at all to your CI workflows.** These are easy to migrate to, much cheaper than official runners, and often faster.

[Namespace](https://namespace.so/docs/features/faster-github-actions) provides managed CI runners, remote Docker builders, native Bazel caching and more. It also backs BuildKite Hosted Agents[^2e].

Pricing [here](https://namespace.so/pricing).

- **1-line change to get faster and cheaper builds in most projects.**
- Up to 250GiB disk storage and terabytes of cache, considerably more than both BuildJet and GitHub official runners.
- High-performance caching via mounted volumes backed by local storage. This is a separate API from [`actions/cache`](https://github.com/actions/cache), but much faster and more reliable.
- Built-in observability for CPU, memory, and storage usage. Streams and retains Docker container logs in addition to runner logs. Remote terminal (SSH) access.
- Dedicated high-performance remote Docker builders with zero-configuration incremental caching, ARM support, and more.[^2b]
- Supports ephemeral previews running on runners as well as separate instances, based on Docker[^2c] or Kubernetes[^2d].
- macOS runners on Apple Silicon (M4 Pro and M2 Pro) with Remote terminal (SSH) and Remote Display (VNC) access.
- SOC 2 Type 2 compliant.[^2f]
- **(Coming soon)** Windows support (Q1 2025). üöß
